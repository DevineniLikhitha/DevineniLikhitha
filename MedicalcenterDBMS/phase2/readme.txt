I am giving the command line to run the program and inluding sample input arg that I have tested.
 And I made some changes in my database to make the program work. (like the data which have spaces like general medicine to general medicine and for q7 I have inserted data which was not there for phase1.

python proj.py 1 <arg> 
{sample arg- proct}
